## 🔍 Project Summary
This project explores **Generative AI** through a **Markov Chain language model**.  
It trains on motivational quotes and generates new inspirational text based on learned word transitions.

---

## 🚀 Features
- NLP preprocessing (cleaning, lowercasing, punctuation removal)
- Train/Test split for evaluation
- Bigram Markov Chain model for generation
- Visualization of dataset word frequency
- Saving generated samples & trained model
